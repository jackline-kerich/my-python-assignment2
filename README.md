The list_operations.py script performs the following operations on a list:

Creates an empty list called my_list.
Appends the elements 10, 20, 30, and 40 to my_list.
Inserts the value 15 at the second position of the list.
Extends my_list with another list: [50, 60, 70].
Removes the last element from my_list.
Sorts my_list in ascending order.
Finds and prints the index of the value 30 in the list.
